# gui-mcp

Virtual-time tools are `get_clock`, `clock_install`, `clock_pause`,
`clock_run_for`, and `clock_resume`. They control only work explicitly connected
to GuaClock, not engine-global time.

`gui-mcp` is the MCP server for the Gua runtime UI automation protocol.

It proxies MCP tool calls to a running Gua WebSocket bridge, so game runtimes keep
owning the semantic UI tree while MCP clients consume the protocol.

## Usage

```sh
bunx gui-mcp@latest mcp
```

The server connects to `ws://127.0.0.1:8765` by default. Set
`GUA_BRIDGE_URL` for another runtime adapter and `GUA_ARTIFACT_DIR` to control
where recordings, baselines, and visual failure artifacts are written. The
artifact directory defaults to `.gua`; tool-provided names are sanitized and
cannot escape that directory.

## Semantic actions

AI clients can inspect the tree and invoke all protocol v1 semantic actions:

- `get_ui_tree`, `wait_for_node`, `get_screenshot`, `get_logs`
- `get_world_object_tree`, `find_world_objects`, `wait_for_world_object`
- `click_node`, `focus_node`, `set_value`, `set_checked`, `select`, `scroll`, `press_key`
- `run_test` for a small wait/click sequence

When the bridge returns a `requestId`, action tools poll the correlated host
completion event. Enqueue acceptance alone is not reported as completion.

World tools are read-only and use the observation profile fixed by the host. Set
`GUA_OBSERVATION_PROFILE=player` on the native host for player-facing MCP use;
tool arguments cannot elevate it to debug. `find_world_objects` accepts ID,
kind, label, tag, parent scope, visibility, active, and primitive state criteria.
There is deliberately no world action tool.

The same host profile also projects the Semantic UI Tree and authorizes UI
actions before the bridge responds. In player mode, private or effectively
hidden nodes are indistinguishable from missing nodes, field rules are applied
before queries and waits, debug logs are omitted, and screenshots are disabled.
Neither `gui-mcp` nor WebMCP tool schemas accept an observation-profile override.

## Recording and replay

`start_recording` records subsequent semantic action tools. `stop_recording`
returns a `recording.schema.json` v1 document, and `save_recording` writes the
last completed recording under `<artifact-dir>/recordings`.

`replay_recording` accepts an inline recording, a saved recording name, or the
last completed recording. It supports recorded semantic wait conditions and
request-correlated completion. Sensitive `set_value` steps store only a
`secretKey`; replay values are supplied through the tool's in-memory `secrets`
map and are not written to the recording.
Coordinate fallback documents can be loaded, but replay rejects them by default;
MCP automation stays on semantic targets.

## Visual comparison

`compare_screenshot` compares the latest `data:image/png;base64` screenshot with
an explicit test name and renderer/OS variant. Baseline creation or replacement
requires `updateBaseline: true`. A failure writes `actual.png`, `expected.png`
when available, `diff.png`, and `comparison.json` under the artifact directory.
`get_visual_artifacts` returns the latest manifest and artifact paths.
